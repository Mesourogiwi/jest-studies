### This project is a study of jest

In this project I learned about some features of jest, using unit and integration test besides few modules that I added, like supertest, factory-girl, faker and so on
Furthermore I want to build another project with more things that I want to learn, which includes:

- Prisma
- Serverless/AWS
- GraphQL
- Docker
- Github Actions
- Nest.js
