### This project is a study of jest

In this project I learned about some features of jest, using unit and integration test besides few modules that I added, like supertest, factory-girl, faker and so on.

Furthermore I want to build another project with more things that I want to learn, which includes:

- Prisma
- Serverless/AWS
- GraphQL
- Docker
- Github Actions
- Nest.js

To run this project, first thing you want to do is install the dependencies

```yarn install```

OR

```npm install```

Once your done with install, don't forget to add .env and .env.test files and connect with your local database

Finally, run

```yarn test```

OR

```npm run test```
